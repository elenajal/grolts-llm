However, it does not explicitly discuss the use of time-varying or time-invariant covariates at the level of the dependent or independent variables. The critical aspect for replication is whether the analysis controls for factors that could vary over time or are constant. Given the information provided, it seems the analysis focuses on the relationship between the covariates and group membership without explicitly addressing time-varying or time-invariant aspects.
