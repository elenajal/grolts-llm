(i.e., wave, hours, days, weeks, months, years, etc.)\n\nCONTEXT: This modified version of the PTCI (PTCI-A) measured negative cognitions about oneself (four items, e.g. \"I have permanently changed for the worse\"), negative cognitions about the world (four items, e.g. \"you can never know who will harm you\"), self-blame (two items, e.g. \"the accident happened because of the way I acted\"), and negative appraisals regarding the parents' perception of damage to their child (two items, e.g., \"I think my child was too badly frightened by the accident and won't get over it\"). Agreement with each item was rated using a 1 (don't agree at all) to 5 (agree a lot) scale. At T1, PTCI-A showed high overall internal consistency (a \u00bc .85). The first three subscales also each showed good internal consistency (oneself, a \u00bc .82; the world, a \u00bc .81; self-blame, a \u00bc .71), while the damage to child subscale showed adequate internal consistency (a \u00bc .64).\n\nFamily Functioning. How the trauma negatively impacted on family functioning was measured using the \"irritable distress\" subscale of the Family Functioning Questionnaire ([McFarlane, 1987\\)](#page-7-0). Parents reported on six items that assessed the level of family irritability specifically following the trauma (e.g., \"Since the frightening event we are more irritable\"). Parents rated their responses on a 3-point scale (1 \u00bc does not apply to 3 \u00bc certainly applies). Internal consistency at T1 for these six items was a \u00bc .80.\n\n#### Parental PTSD\n\nThe Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS; [Foa,](#page-7-0) [Cashman, Jaycox, & Perry, 1997](#page-7-0)) was completed by parents in relation to the event that their child was involved in. The PDS is a widely used 17-item selfreport questionnaire for assessing PTSD symptoms, based on DSM-IV criteria for PTSD (possible total scores range from 0 to 51). A score between 1 and 10 is considered mild, a score between 11 and 20 moderate, scores between 21 and 35 moderate to severe, and scores of 36 considered severe. T1 data confirmed the measures high internal consistency (Cronbach's a \u00bc .92).\n\n#### Statistical Analyses\n\nGroup-based trajectory analysis was performed using the TRAJ command ([Jones & Nagin, 2013](#page-7-0)) in STATA ([Stata, 2013](#page-8-0)), adapted from PROC TRAJ ([Jones,](#page-7-0) [Nagin and Roeder, 2001](#page-7-0)). We used the zero-inflated Poisson model. This analysis was used to identify clusters of individuals with similar growth trajectories. PROC TRAJ does not provide any individual-level information on the pattern of change over time; subjects are grouped and it is assumed that every subject in the group follows the same trajectory. We followed the lead of [D'Unger, Land, McCall, and Nagin \\(1998\\)](#page-7-0) and used the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) as a basis for selecting the optimal model (see [Raftery, 1995\\)](#page-8-0). They recommend selection of the model with the maximum BIC. [Jones et al. \\(2001\\)](#page-7-0) suggest criteria for strength of evidence against the null model, using the difference in model BICs. Within each group, values of average posterior probability of membership were ascertained; values of >0.7 indicated adequate internal reliability ([Niyonkuru, et al., 2013\\)](#page-8-0).\n\n\n\nRegarding measures used in this study, the full questionnaire battery was administered to parents at 2\u20134 weeks post-trauma (T1), while PTSD symptoms were measured again at 6 months (T2) and 3 years post-trauma (T3). Parents typically completed the assessments in their home as part of the larger assessment (see [Meiser-Stedman et al., 2008](#page-8-0)). The only exception to this was the 3-year follow-up, when questionnaires were completed online or returned by post.\n\n#### Measures\n\n# Demographic Variables and Objective Trauma Severity\n\nDemographic and trauma-related information was obtained from parent interviews and from ED notes at T1 (see Table I). Objective trauma severity for the child was assessed using triage category (nurse rating of urgency of care), whether the child was admitted to hospital, and presence of physical injury (whether or not they sustained a fracture).\n\n# Trait Cognitive Vulnerability\n\nTwo measures assessed general trait cognitive vulnerability; The Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI; [Reiss,](#page-8-0) [Peterson, Gursky, & McNally, 1986\\)](#page-8-0) and the Meta-Cognitions Questionnaire-30-Positive Beliefs about Worry Scale (MCQ-30-PB; [Wells & Cartwright-](#page-8-0)[Hatton, 2004](#page-8-0)). The ASI is a 16-item self-report questionnaire that measures negative beliefs about anxiety as recorded on a 0 (very little) to 4 (very much) scale of agreement with statements such as \"It scares me when I feel faint.\"The measure is considered to be reliable and valid [\\(Peterson & Heilbronner, 1987;](#page-8-0) [Vujanovic et al., 2007](#page-8-0)), with adequate internal consistency also demonstrated in the current study (T1 Cronbach's a \u00bc .91). The MCQ-30-PB is a six-item scale where responses are scored on a 4-point (1\u20134) agreement scale, for statements such as \"I need to worry in order to work well\" and \"worrying helps me\n\nTable I.

[Jones et al. \\(2001\\)](#page-7-0) suggest criteria for strength of evidence against the null model, using the difference in model BICs. Within each group, values of average posterior probability of membership were ascertained; values of >0.7 indicated adequate internal reliability ([Niyonkuru, et al., 2013\\)](#page-8-0).\n\nAs two trajectories, which we discuss later, were identified (having the maximum BIC and with an average posterior group probability >0.70), logistic regressions were then used to explore early predictors (from T1) of trajectory membership. Seven regressions were used to provide a preliminary exploration of predictors of trajectory membership (high trajectory vs. low trajectory). Variables were grouped based on the construct measured. That is, each logistic regression assessed the predictive value of a different construct. Regressions were (1) objective trauma severity, (2) the parent's direct involvement in the collision versus hearing of the collision, (3) trait cognitive style, (4) peri-trauma variables, (5) posttrauma cognitive style (e.g., rumination), (6) post-trauma maladaptive cognitions (e.g., unsafe world, damage to child), and (7) family irritable distress. In all regressions, variables were added as a single step. A final logistic regression was then run with all significant predictors to explore what variables would be the sole unique predictor of trajectory membership.\n\n# Results\n\n#### Descriptive Statistics\n\nDescriptive statistics for the sample are presented in [Table I](#page-2-0). The mean scores and correlations between key predictor variables are presented in Table II. Sixty-five percent of the parents were directly involved in the MVC, while 35% heard of their child's involvement after the event. The large majority of participants were the mother of the child (89.5%). Regarding PTSD symptom severity, mean scores on the PDS were as follows: T1: M \u00bc 10.42, SD \u00bc 9.95; T2: M \u00bc 7.13, SD \u00bc 9.05; T3: M \u00bc 3.39, SD \u00bc 4.82. Initial scores on the PDS are in line with other, largescale studies of parental PTSD, assessed using this measure [\\(Landolt, Vollrath, Ribi, Gnehm, &](#page-7-0) [Sennhauser, 2003](#page-7-0)). Of those parents who completed the PDS at T1 (-4 weeks post-trauma; N \u00bc 88), 11% (n \u00bc 10) reported no symptoms, 47% (n \u00bc 41) reported mild symptoms, 24% (n \u00bc 21) reported moderate symptoms, 15% (n \u00bc 13) reported moderate to severe symptoms, and 3% (n \u00bc 3) reported severe symptoms. Of those parents who completed the PDS at T2 (6 months post-trauma; N \u00bc 56), 23% (n \u00bc 13) reported no symptoms, 54% (n \u00bc 30) reported mild PTSD symptoms, 13% (n \u00bc 7) reported moderate symptoms, 9% (n \u00bc 5) reported moderate to severe symptoms, and 2% (n \u00bc 1) reported severe symptoms. Finally, of the 52 parents who provided PDS scores at T3 (3 years posttrauma), 35% (n \u00bc 18) reported no symptoms, 58% (n \u00bc 30) reported mild PTSD symptoms, 6% (n \u00bc 3) reported moderate symptoms, 2% (n \u00bc 1) reported moderate to severe symptoms, and no parent reported severe PTSD symptoms.\n\n\n\n- McLaughlin, K.

Besides the typical post-trauma maladaptive appraisals commonly associated with adult PTSD (e.g., negative selfappraisals), we also assessed cognitive appraisals concerning impact on the child (i.e., permanent psychological change to their child), to provide a comprehensive exploration of post-trauma appraisals that may be unique to the development of parental PTSD following child trauma exposure.\n\n# <span id=\"page-2-0\"></span>Method\n\n# Participants\n\nParticipants were parents/carers of 2\u201310-year-old children who were consecutively admitted to a participating emergency department (ED) following the child's involvement in a MVC. Three EDs were involved in recruitment, all of which were located in low socioeconomic boroughs of London. A full description of this sample and recruitment process can be found in [Meiser-Stedman, Smith, Glucksman, Yule, and](#page-8-0) [Dalgleish \\(2008\\)](#page-8-0). Parents were excluded if they did not have sufficient English language skills to complete the measures. A total of 312 children were eligible to participate in the study; the families of 120 (38.5%) could not be contacted, while the families of 114 (36.5%) agreed to participate. There were no differences in the age, gender, or triage level (objective trauma severity) for the children of participants versus nonparticipants (p > .05).\n\nTo perform the trajectory analysis, scores on the PTSD measure are required on at least two of the time points (explained in more detail in the 'Statistical Analysis' section). Consequently, of the 114 parents who consented to participate, data from 95 parents were included in the current study. The majority of participants were mothers (n \u00bc 80, 83%), with the remainder comprising fathers (n \u00bc 7, 7%) and other relations (e.g., aunts, adult siblings, n \u00bc 8, 8%). Eightyeight of the 95 participants completed the assessment at T1 ( < 4 weeks posttrauma), 56 completed the T2 assessment (6 months posttrauma), and 52 completed the T3 assessment (3 years posttrauma). There was no difference in the baseline parental PTSD symptom severity (t(86) \u00bc 1.09, p \u00bc .28) of those who did and did not complete follow-ups.\n\n#### Procedure\n\nThis study was granted original ethical approval by the institutional review board at the Institute of Psychiatry and South London and Maudsley NHS Trust Research Ethics Committee, with permission for the 3-year follow-up granted by the Bexley & Greenwich Research Ethics Committee. Where possible, research team members, in consultation with clinical staff, approached eligible families on the ward to explain the study. In some instances, eligible parents were recruited via letter following attendance at the ED. Regarding measures used in this study, the full questionnaire battery was administered to parents at 2\u20134 weeks post-trauma (T1), while PTSD symptoms were measured again at 6 months (T2) and 3 years post-trauma (T3). Parents typically completed the assessments in their home as part of the larger assessment (see [Meiser-Stedman et al., 2008](#page-8-0)). \n"}]}], "temperature": 0.0}}

The two trajectories are subsequently referred to as low symptom trajectory (coded as 0) and high symptom trajectory (coded as 1).\n\n# Preliminary Investigation of Predictors of Trajectory Membership\n\nDemographic information about the child (age, gender, prior trauma) failed to predict the trajectory of the parents' symptoms (age: v<sup>2</sup> (1) \u00bc 0.12, p \u00bc .73; gender: v<sup>2</sup> (1) \u00bc 0.004, p \u00bc .95; prior trauma: v2 (1) \u00bc 0.0.57, p \u00bc .45).<sup>1</sup> Objective trauma severity, based on triage rating (i.e., urgency of care when arrived at hospital) also failed to predict symptom trajectory (v<sup>2</sup> (1) \u00bc 1.74, p \u00bc .19, odds ratio (OR) \u00bc 0.76 [0.51, 1.14]).<sup>2</sup>\n\nWhether the parent was directly involved in the collision or heard of it later also failed to predict symptom trajectory (v<sup>2</sup> (1) \u00bc 1.96, p \u00bc .16, OR \u00bc 0.52 [0.27, 1.30]). When explored by construct in individual regressions, subjective threat at the time of the trauma, thought suppression, maladaptive cognitions about permanent damage to the child, and family irritable distress all significantly predicted trajectory membership (see Table III for results, as well as the list of variables in each regression). In all cases, the presence of more problematic responses (e.g., more maladaptive cognitions, higher reported family irritable distress) were predictive of increased likelihood of being on the high symptom trajectory rather than low symptom trajectory. When all significant variables were added to one model (listed in Table III)\n\nRegression model (bolded): Peri-trauma variables, \u03c7\u00b2(1): Dissociation, p: 2.87, OR [95% CI]: .050, : 1.20 [1.00, 1.44].\n\u03c7\u00b2(1): Subjective threat*, p: 6.56, OR [95% CI]: .01, : 1.29 [1.06, 1.57].\nRegression model (bolded): Trait cognitive vulnerability, \u03c7\u00b2(1): Anxiety sensitivity, p: 1.01, OR [95% CI]: .32, : 1.02 [0.98, 1.05].\n\u03c7\u00b2(1): Positive beliefs about worry, p: 3.39, OR [95% CI]: .07, : 1.10 [0.99, 1.22].\nRegression model (bolded): Cognitive style, \u03c7\u00b2(1): Thought suppression*, p: 4.68, OR [95% CI]: .03, : 1.69 [1.05, 2.72].\n\n\n- McLaughlin, K.

Agreement with each item was rated using a 1 (don't agree at all) to 5 (agree a lot) scale. At T1, PTCI-A showed high overall internal consistency (a \u00bc .85). The first three subscales also each showed good internal consistency (oneself, a \u00bc .82; the world, a \u00bc .81; self-blame, a \u00bc .71), while the damage to child subscale showed adequate internal consistency (a \u00bc .64).\n\nFamily Functioning. How the trauma negatively impacted on family functioning was measured using the \"irritable distress\" subscale of the Family Functioning Questionnaire ([McFarlane, 1987\\)](#page-7-0). Parents reported on six items that assessed the level of family irritability specifically following the trauma (e.g., \"Since the frightening event we are more irritable\"). Parents rated their responses on a 3-point scale (1 \u00bc does not apply to 3 \u00bc certainly applies). Internal consistency at T1 for these six items was a \u00bc .80.\n\n#### Parental PTSD\n\nThe Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS; [Foa,](#page-7-0) [Cashman, Jaycox, & Perry, 1997](#page-7-0)) was completed by parents in relation to the event that their child was involved in. The PDS is a widely used 17-item selfreport questionnaire for assessing PTSD symptoms, based on DSM-IV criteria for PTSD (possible total scores range from 0 to 51). A score between 1 and 10 is considered mild, a score between 11 and 20 moderate, scores between 21 and 35 moderate to severe, and scores of 36 considered severe. T1 data confirmed the measures high internal consistency (Cronbach's a \u00bc .92).\n\n#### Statistical Analyses\n\nGroup-based trajectory analysis was performed using the TRAJ command ([Jones & Nagin, 2013](#page-7-0)) in STATA ([Stata, 2013](#page-8-0)), adapted from PROC TRAJ ([Jones,](#page-7-0) [Nagin and Roeder, 2001](#page-7-0)). We used the zero-inflated Poisson model. This analysis was used to identify clusters of individuals with similar growth trajectories. PROC TRAJ does not provide any individual-level information on the pattern of change over time; subjects are grouped and it is assumed that every subject in the group follows the same trajectory. We followed the lead of [D'Unger, Land, McCall, and Nagin \\(1998\\)](#page-7-0) and used the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) as a basis for selecting the optimal model (see [Raftery, 1995\\)](#page-8-0). They recommend selection of the model with the maximum BIC. [Jones et al. \\(2001\\)](#page-7-0) suggest criteria for strength of evidence against the null model, using the difference in model BICs. Within each group, values of average posterior probability of membership were ascertained; values of >0.7 indicated adequate internal reliability ([Niyonkuru, et al., 2013\\)](#page-8-0).\n\n\n\nRegarding measures used in this study, the full questionnaire battery was administered to parents at 2\u20134 weeks post-trauma (T1), while PTSD symptoms were measured again at 6 months (T2) and 3 years post-trauma (T3). Parents typically completed the assessments in their home as part of the larger assessment (see [Meiser-Stedman et al., 2008](#page-8-0)). The only exception to this was the 3-year follow-up, when questionnaires were completed online or returned by post.\n\n#### Measures\n\n# Demographic Variables and Objective Trauma Severity\n\nDemographic and trauma-related information was obtained from parent interviews and from ED notes at T1 (see Table I). Objective trauma severity for the child was assessed using triage category (nurse rating of urgency of care), whether the child was admitted to hospital, and presence of physical injury (whether or not they sustained a fracture).\n\n# Trait Cognitive Vulnerability\n\nTwo measures assessed general trait cognitive vulnerability; The Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI; [Reiss,](#page-8-0) [Peterson, Gursky, & McNally, 1986\\)](#page-8-0) and the Meta-Cognitions Questionnaire-30-Positive Beliefs about Worry Scale (MCQ-30-PB; [Wells & Cartwright-](#page-8-0)[Hatton, 2004](#page-8-0)). The ASI is a 16-item self-report questionnaire that measures negative beliefs about anxiety as recorded on a 0 (very little) to 4 (very much) scale of agreement with statements such as \"It scares me when I feel faint.\"The measure is considered to be reliable and valid [\\(Peterson & Heilbronner, 1987;](#page-8-0) [Vujanovic et al., 2007](#page-8-0)), with adequate internal consistency also demonstrated in the current study (T1 Cronbach's a \u00bc .91). The MCQ-30-PB is a six-item scale where responses are scored on a 4-point (1\u20134) agreement scale, for statements such as \"I need to worry in order to work well\" and \"worrying helps me\n\nTable I.

Agreement with each item was rated using a 1 (don't agree at all) to 5 (agree a lot) scale. At T1, PTCI-A showed high overall internal consistency (a \u00bc .85). The first three subscales also each showed good internal consistency (oneself, a \u00bc .82; the world, a \u00bc .81; self-blame, a \u00bc .71), while the damage to child subscale showed adequate internal consistency (a \u00bc .64).\n\nFamily Functioning. How the trauma negatively impacted on family functioning was measured using the \"irritable distress\" subscale of the Family Functioning Questionnaire ([McFarlane, 1987\\)](#page-7-0). Parents reported on six items that assessed the level of family irritability specifically following the trauma (e.g., \"Since the frightening event we are more irritable\"). Parents rated their responses on a 3-point scale (1 \u00bc does not apply to 3 \u00bc certainly applies). Internal consistency at T1 for these six items was a \u00bc .80.\n\n#### Parental PTSD\n\nThe Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS; [Foa,](#page-7-0) [Cashman, Jaycox, & Perry, 1997](#page-7-0)) was completed by parents in relation to the event that their child was involved in. The PDS is a widely used 17-item selfreport questionnaire for assessing PTSD symptoms, based on DSM-IV criteria for PTSD (possible total scores range from 0 to 51). A score between 1 and 10 is considered mild, a score between 11 and 20 moderate, scores between 21 and 35 moderate to severe, and scores of 36 considered severe. T1 data confirmed the measures high internal consistency (Cronbach's a \u00bc .92).\n\n#### Statistical Analyses\n\nGroup-based trajectory analysis was performed using the TRAJ command ([Jones & Nagin, 2013](#page-7-0)) in STATA ([Stata, 2013](#page-8-0)), adapted from PROC TRAJ ([Jones,](#page-7-0) [Nagin and Roeder, 2001](#page-7-0)). We used the zero-inflated Poisson model. This analysis was used to identify clusters of individuals with similar growth trajectories. PROC TRAJ does not provide any individual-level information on the pattern of change over time; subjects are grouped and it is assumed that every subject in the group follows the same trajectory. We followed the lead of [D'Unger, Land, McCall, and Nagin \\(1998\\)](#page-7-0) and used the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) as a basis for selecting the optimal model (see [Raftery, 1995\\)](#page-8-0). They recommend selection of the model with the maximum BIC. [Jones et al. \\(2001\\)](#page-7-0) suggest criteria for strength of evidence against the null model, using the difference in model BICs. Within each group, values of average posterior probability of membership were ascertained; values of >0.7 indicated adequate internal reliability ([Niyonkuru, et al., 2013\\)](#page-8-0).\n\n\n\nThey recommend selection of the model with the maximum BIC. [Jones et al. \\(2001\\)](#page-7-0) suggest criteria for strength of evidence against the null model, using the difference in model BICs. Within each group, values of average posterior probability of membership were ascertained; values of >0.7 indicated adequate internal reliability ([Niyonkuru, et al., 2013\\)](#page-8-0).\n\nAs two trajectories, which we discuss later, were identified (having the maximum BIC and with an average posterior group probability >0.70), logistic regressions were then used to explore early predictors (from T1) of trajectory membership. Seven regressions were used to provide a preliminary exploration of predictors of trajectory membership (high trajectory vs. low trajectory). Variables were grouped based on the construct measured. That is, each logistic regression assessed the predictive value of a different construct. Regressions were (1) objective trauma severity, (2) the parent's direct involvement in the collision versus hearing of the collision, (3) trait cognitive style, (4) peri-trauma variables, (5) posttrauma cognitive style (e.g., rumination), (6) post-trauma maladaptive cognitions (e.g., unsafe world, damage to child), and (7) family irritable distress. In all regressions, variables were added as a single step. A final logistic regression was then run with all significant predictors to explore what variables would be the sole unique predictor of trajectory membership.\n\n# Results\n\n#### Descriptive Statistics\n\nDescriptive statistics for the sample are presented in [Table I](#page-2-0). The mean scores and correlations between key predictor variables are presented in Table II. Sixty-five percent of the parents were directly involved in the MVC, while 35% heard of their child's involvement after the event. The large majority of participants were the mother of the child (89.5%). Regarding PTSD symptom severity, mean scores on the PDS were as follows: T1: M \u00bc 10.42, SD \u00bc 9.95; T2: M \u00bc 7.13, SD \u00bc 9.05; T3: M \u00bc 3.39, SD \u00bc 4.82. Initial scores on the PDS are in line with other, largescale studies of parental PTSD, assessed using this measure [\\(Landolt, Vollrath, Ribi, Gnehm, &](#page-7-0) [Sennhauser, 2003](#page-7-0)). Of those parents who completed the PDS at T1 (-4 weeks post-trauma; N \u00bc 88), 11% (n \u00bc 10) reported no symptoms, 47% (n \u00bc 41) reported mild symptoms, 24% (n \u00bc 21) reported moderate symptoms, 15% (n \u00bc 13) reported moderate to severe symptoms, and 3% (n \u00bc 3) reported severe symptoms. Of those parents who completed the PDS at T2 (6 months post-trauma; N \u00bc 56), 23% (n \u00bc 13) reported no symptoms, 54% (n \u00bc 30) reported mild PTSD symptoms, 13% (n \u00bc 7) reported moderate symptoms, 9% (n \u00bc 5) reported moderate to severe symptoms, and 2% (n \u00bc 1) reported severe symptoms. Finally, of the 52 parents who provided PDS scores at T3 (3 years posttrauma), 35% (n \u00bc 18) reported no symptoms, 58% (n \u00bc 30) reported mild PTSD symptoms, 6% (n \u00bc 3) reported moderate symptoms, 2% (n \u00bc 1) reported moderate to severe symptoms, and no parent reported severe PTSD symptoms.\n\n\n\nDemographic characteristics: 2, Frequency (%) (N = 95): 12 (12.7%).\nDemographic characteristics: 3, Frequency (%) (N = 95): 18 (19.1%).\nDemographic characteristics: 4, Frequency (%) (N = 95): 55 (58.5%).\nDemographic characteristics: Fracture, Frequency (%) (N = 95): 6 (6.3%).\nDemographic characteristics: Parent present at trauma, Frequency (%) (N = 95): 62 (65.3%).\n\nNote.

Parents reported on each statement using a 1 (don't agree at all) to 4 (agree a lot) scale. Items were based on previously used measures [\\(Dunmore, Clark,](#page-7-0) [& Ehlers, 2001](#page-7-0); [Ehlers, Mayou, & Bryant, 1998;](#page-7-0) [Steil](#page-8-0) [and Ehlers 2000](#page-8-0)). Dissociation was assessed using five statements (e.g., \"I didn't feel like I was really there\"), while their subjective threat was assessed using four statements (e.g., \"I was scared that my child might be badly hurt\"). Internal consistency for the dissociation and subjective threat items were Cronbach's a \u00bc .62 and a \u00bc .63, respectively.\n\n#### Posttrauma Variables\n\nParents also completed three measures to capture post-trauma cognitive style, maladaptive cognitions, and family dysfunction.\n\nRumination and Thought Suppression. Parents rated their level of agreement about three rumination statements (e.g., \"I keep wishing that I could go back in time and prevent the event from happening\") and one thought suppression statement (\"When I have thoughts or memories about what happened, I try hard to push them out of my mind\"), with ratings from 1 (don't agree at all) to 4 (agree a lot). Items were created based on the literature on the impact of these cognitive processes on PTSD (e.g., [Ehlers et al., 1998](#page-7-0); [Kleim &](#page-7-0) [Ehlers, 2008](#page-7-0)). At T1, these items demonstrated adequate internal consistency, Cronbach's a \u00bc .81.\n\nMaladaptive Appraisals. Parents' post-trauma negative appraisals were assessed using a modified version of the Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory (PTCI; [Foa,](#page-7-0) [Ehlers, Clark, Tolin, & Orsillo, 1999\\)](#page-7-0). This modified version of the PTCI (PTCI-A) measured negative cognitions about oneself (four items, e.g. \"I have permanently changed for the worse\"), negative cognitions about the world (four items, e.g. \"you can never know who will harm you\"), self-blame (two items, e.g. \"the accident happened because of the way I acted\"), and negative appraisals regarding the parents' perception of damage to their child (two items, e.g., \"I think my child was too badly frightened by the accident and won't get over it\"). Agreement with each item was rated using a 1 (don't agree at all) to 5 (agree a lot) scale. \n\nRegarding measures used in this study, the full questionnaire battery was administered to parents at 2\u20134 weeks post-trauma (T1), while PTSD symptoms were measured again at 6 months (T2) and 3 years post-trauma (T3). Parents typically completed the assessments in their home as part of the larger assessment (see [Meiser-Stedman et al., 2008](#page-8-0)). The only exception to this was the 3-year follow-up, when questionnaires were completed online or returned by post.\n\n#### Measures\n\n# Demographic Variables and Objective Trauma Severity\n\nDemographic and trauma-related information was obtained from parent interviews and from ED notes at T1 (see Table I). Objective trauma severity for the child was assessed using triage category (nurse rating of urgency of care), whether the child was admitted to hospital, and presence of physical injury (whether or not they sustained a fracture).\n\n# Trait Cognitive Vulnerability\n\nTwo measures assessed general trait cognitive vulnerability; The Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI; [Reiss,](#page-8-0) [Peterson, Gursky, & McNally, 1986\\)](#page-8-0) and the Meta-Cognitions Questionnaire-30-Positive Beliefs about Worry Scale (MCQ-30-PB; [Wells & Cartwright-](#page-8-0)[Hatton, 2004](#page-8-0)). The ASI is a 16-item self-report questionnaire that measures negative beliefs about anxiety as recorded on a 0 (very little) to 4 (very much) scale of agreement with statements such as \"It scares me when I feel faint.\"The measure is considered to be reliable and valid [\\(Peterson & Heilbronner, 1987;](#page-8-0) [Vujanovic et al., 2007](#page-8-0)), with adequate internal consistency also demonstrated in the current study (T1 Cronbach's a \u00bc .91). The MCQ-30-PB is a six-item scale where responses are scored on a 4-point (1\u20134) agreement scale, for statements such as \"I need to worry in order to work well\" and \"worrying helps me\n\nTable I.

Besides the typical post-trauma maladaptive appraisals commonly associated with adult PTSD (e.g., negative selfappraisals), we also assessed cognitive appraisals concerning impact on the child (i.e., permanent psychological change to their child), to provide a comprehensive exploration of post-trauma appraisals that may be unique to the development of parental PTSD following child trauma exposure.\n\n# <span id=\"page-2-0\"></span>Method\n\n# Participants\n\nParticipants were parents/carers of 2\u201310-year-old children who were consecutively admitted to a participating emergency department (ED) following the child's involvement in a MVC.

A full description of this sample and recruitment process can be found in [Meiser-Stedman, Smith, Glucksman, Yule, and](#page-8-0) [Dalgleish \\(2008\\)](#page-8-0). Parents were excluded if they did not have sufficient English language skills to complete the measures. A total of 312 children were eligible to participate in the study; the families of 120 (38.5%) could not be contacted, while the families of 114 (36.5%) agreed to participate. There were no differences in the age, gender, or triage level (objective trauma severity) for the children of participants versus nonparticipants (p > .05).\n\nTo perform the trajectory analysis, scores on the PTSD measure are required on at least two of the time points (explained in more detail in the 'Statistical Analysis' section). Consequently, of the 114 parents who consented to participate, data from 95 parents were included in the current study. The majority of participants were mothers (n \u00bc 80, 83%), with the remainder comprising fathers (n \u00bc 7, 7%) and other relations (e.g., aunts, adult siblings, n \u00bc 8, 8%). Eightyeight of the 95 participants completed the assessment at T1 ( < 4 weeks posttrauma), 56 completed the T2 assessment (6 months posttrauma), and 52 completed the T3 assessment (3 years posttrauma). There was no difference in the baseline parental PTSD symptom severity (t(86) \u00bc 1.09, p \u00bc .28) of those who did and did not complete follow-ups.\n\n#### Procedure\n\nThis study was granted original ethical approval by the institutional review board at the Institute of Psychiatry and South London and Maudsley NHS Trust Research Ethics Committee, with permission for the 3-year follow-up granted by the Bexley & Greenwich Research Ethics Committee. Where possible, research team members, in consultation with clinical staff, approached eligible families on the ward to explain the study. In some instances, eligible parents were recruited via letter following attendance at the ED. Regarding measures used in this study, the full questionnaire battery was administered to parents at 2\u20134 weeks post-trauma (T1), while PTSD symptoms were measured again at 6 months (T2) and 3 years post-trauma (T3). Parents typically completed the assessments in their home as part of the larger assessment (see [Meiser-Stedman et al., 2008](#page-8-0)). \n"}]}], "temperature": 0.0}}

Agreement with each item was rated using a 1 (don't agree at all) to 5 (agree a lot) scale. At T1, PTCI-A showed high overall internal consistency (a \u00bc .85). The first three subscales also each showed good internal consistency (oneself, a \u00bc .82; the world, a \u00bc .81; self-blame, a \u00bc .71), while the damage to child subscale showed adequate internal consistency (a \u00bc .64).\n\nFamily Functioning. How the trauma negatively impacted on family functioning was measured using the \"irritable distress\" subscale of the Family Functioning Questionnaire ([McFarlane, 1987\\)](#page-7-0). Parents reported on six items that assessed the level of family irritability specifically following the trauma (e.g., \"Since the frightening event we are more irritable\"). Parents rated their responses on a 3-point scale (1 \u00bc does not apply to 3 \u00bc certainly applies). Internal consistency at T1 for these six items was a \u00bc .80.\n\n#### Parental PTSD\n\nThe Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS; [Foa,](#page-7-0) [Cashman, Jaycox, & Perry, 1997](#page-7-0)) was completed by parents in relation to the event that their child was involved in. The PDS is a widely used 17-item selfreport questionnaire for assessing PTSD symptoms, based on DSM-IV criteria for PTSD (possible total scores range from 0 to 51). A score between 1 and 10 is considered mild, a score between 11 and 20 moderate, scores between 21 and 35 moderate to severe, and scores of 36 considered severe. T1 data confirmed the measures high internal consistency (Cronbach's a \u00bc .92).\n\n#### Statistical Analyses\n\nGroup-based trajectory analysis was performed using the TRAJ command ([Jones & Nagin, 2013](#page-7-0)) in STATA ([Stata, 2013](#page-8-0)), adapted from PROC TRAJ ([Jones,](#page-7-0) [Nagin and Roeder, 2001](#page-7-0)). We used the zero-inflated Poisson model. This analysis was used to identify clusters of individuals with similar growth trajectories. PROC TRAJ does not provide any individual-level information on the pattern of change over time; subjects are grouped and it is assumed that every subject in the group follows the same trajectory. We followed the lead of [D'Unger, Land, McCall, and Nagin \\(1998\\)](#page-7-0) and used the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) as a basis for selecting the optimal model (see [Raftery, 1995\\)](#page-8-0). They recommend selection of the model with the maximum BIC. [Jones et al. \\(2001\\)](#page-7-0) suggest criteria for strength of evidence against the null model, using the difference in model BICs. Within each group, values of average posterior probability of membership were ascertained; values of >0.7 indicated adequate internal reliability ([Niyonkuru, et al., 2013\\)](#page-8-0).\n\n\n\nThey recommend selection of the model with the maximum BIC.

Within each group, values of average posterior probability of membership were ascertained; values of >0.7 indicated adequate internal reliability ([Niyonkuru, et al., 2013\\)](#page-8-0).\n\nAs two trajectories, which we discuss later, were identified (having the maximum BIC and with an average posterior group probability >0.70), logistic regressions were then used to explore early predictors (from T1) of trajectory membership. Seven regressions were used to provide a preliminary exploration of predictors of trajectory membership (high trajectory vs. low trajectory). Variables were grouped based on the construct measured. That is, each logistic regression assessed the predictive value of a different construct. Regressions were (1) objective trauma severity, (2) the parent's direct involvement in the collision versus hearing of the collision, (3) trait cognitive style, (4) peri-trauma variables, (5) posttrauma cognitive style (e.g., rumination), (6) post-trauma maladaptive cognitions (e.g., unsafe world, damage to child), and (7) family irritable distress. In all regressions, variables were added as a single step. A final logistic regression was then run with all significant predictors to explore what variables would be the sole unique predictor of trajectory membership.\n\n# Results\n\n#### Descriptive Statistics\n\nDescriptive statistics for the sample are presented in [Table I](#page-2-0). The mean scores and correlations between key predictor variables are presented in Table II. Sixty-five percent of the parents were directly involved in the MVC, while 35% heard of their child's involvement after the event. The large majority of participants were the mother of the child (89.5%). Regarding PTSD symptom severity, mean scores on the PDS were as follows: T1: M \u00bc 10.42, SD \u00bc 9.95; T2: M \u00bc 7.13, SD \u00bc 9.05; T3: M \u00bc 3.39, SD \u00bc 4.82. Initial scores on the PDS are in line with other, largescale studies of parental PTSD, assessed using this measure [\\(Landolt, Vollrath, Ribi, Gnehm, &](#page-7-0) [Sennhauser, 2003](#page-7-0)). Of those parents who completed the PDS at T1 (-4 weeks post-trauma; N \u00bc 88), 11% (n \u00bc 10) reported no symptoms, 47% (n \u00bc 41) reported mild symptoms, 24% (n \u00bc 21) reported moderate symptoms, 15% (n \u00bc 13) reported moderate to severe symptoms, and 3% (n \u00bc 3) reported severe symptoms. Of those parents who completed the PDS at T2 (6 months post-trauma; N \u00bc 56), 23% (n \u00bc 13) reported no symptoms, 54% (n \u00bc 30) reported mild PTSD symptoms, 13% (n \u00bc 7) reported moderate symptoms, 9% (n \u00bc 5) reported moderate to severe symptoms, and 2% (n \u00bc 1) reported severe symptoms. Finally, of the 52 parents who provided PDS scores at T3 (3 years posttrauma), 35% (n \u00bc 18) reported no symptoms, 58% (n \u00bc 30) reported mild PTSD symptoms, 6% (n \u00bc 3) reported moderate symptoms, 2% (n \u00bc 1) reported moderate to severe symptoms, and no parent reported severe PTSD symptoms.\n\n\n\nFinally, of the 52 parents who provided PDS scores at T3 (3 years posttrauma), 35% (n \u00bc 18) reported no symptoms, 58% (n \u00bc 30) reported mild PTSD symptoms, 6% (n \u00bc 3) reported moderate symptoms, 2% (n \u00bc 1) reported moderate to severe symptoms, and no parent reported severe PTSD symptoms.\n\n# Trajectory Analysis\n\nTwo distinct symptom trajectories were identified (see [Figure 1\\)](#page-5-0). Sixty-three percent (63.4%) of participants were allocated to Trajectory 1, which was characterized by continuously low symptoms at all time points. Thirty-seven percent (36.6%) were on Trajectory 2,\n\nTable II.

Parents reported on each statement using a 1 (don't agree at all) to 4 (agree a lot) scale. Items were based on previously used measures [\\(Dunmore, Clark,](#page-7-0) [& Ehlers, 2001](#page-7-0); [Ehlers, Mayou, & Bryant, 1998;](#page-7-0) [Steil](#page-8-0) [and Ehlers 2000](#page-8-0)). Dissociation was assessed using five statements (e.g., \"I didn't feel like I was really there\"), while their subjective threat was assessed using four statements (e.g., \"I was scared that my child might be badly hurt\"). Internal consistency for the dissociation and subjective threat items were Cronbach's a \u00bc .62 and a \u00bc .63, respectively.\n\n#### Posttrauma Variables\n\nParents also completed three measures to capture post-trauma cognitive style, maladaptive cognitions, and family dysfunction.\n\nRumination and Thought Suppression. Parents rated their level of agreement about three rumination statements (e.g., \"I keep wishing that I could go back in time and prevent the event from happening\") and one thought suppression statement (\"When I have thoughts or memories about what happened, I try hard to push them out of my mind\"), with ratings from 1 (don't agree at all) to 4 (agree a lot). Items were created based on the literature on the impact of these cognitive processes on PTSD (e.g., [Ehlers et al., 1998](#page-7-0); [Kleim &](#page-7-0) [Ehlers, 2008](#page-7-0)). At T1, these items demonstrated adequate internal consistency, Cronbach's a \u00bc .81.\n\nMaladaptive Appraisals. Parents' post-trauma negative appraisals were assessed using a modified version of the Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory (PTCI; [Foa,](#page-7-0) [Ehlers, Clark, Tolin, & Orsillo, 1999\\)](#page-7-0). This modified version of the PTCI (PTCI-A) measured negative cognitions about oneself (four items, e.g. \"I have permanently changed for the worse\"), negative cognitions about the world (four items, e.g. \"you can never know who will harm you\"), self-blame (two items, e.g. \"the accident happened because of the way I acted\"), and negative appraisals regarding the parents' perception of damage to their child (two items, e.g., \"I think my child was too badly frightened by the accident and won't get over it\").

[Jones et al. \\(2001\\)](#page-7-0) suggest criteria for strength of evidence against the null model, using the difference in model BICs. Within each group, values of average posterior probability of membership were ascertained; values of >0.7 indicated adequate internal reliability ([Niyonkuru, et al., 2013\\)](#page-8-0).\n\nAs two trajectories, which we discuss later, were identified (having the maximum BIC and with an average posterior group probability >0.70), logistic regressions were then used to explore early predictors (from T1) of trajectory membership. Seven regressions were used to provide a preliminary exploration of predictors of trajectory membership (high trajectory vs. low trajectory). Variables were grouped based on the construct measured. That is, each logistic regression assessed the predictive value of a different construct. Regressions were (1) objective trauma severity, (2) the parent's direct involvement in the collision versus hearing of the collision, (3) trait cognitive style, (4) peri-trauma variables, (5) posttrauma cognitive style (e.g., rumination), (6) post-trauma maladaptive cognitions (e.g., unsafe world, damage to child), and (7) family irritable distress. In all regressions, variables were added as a single step. A final logistic regression was then run with all significant predictors to explore what variables would be the sole unique predictor of trajectory membership.\n\n# Results\n\n#### Descriptive Statistics\n\nDescriptive statistics for the sample are presented in [Table I](#page-2-0). The mean scores and correlations between key predictor variables are presented in Table II. Sixty-five percent of the parents were directly involved in the MVC, while 35% heard of their child's involvement after the event. The large majority of participants were the mother of the child (89.5%). Regarding PTSD symptom severity, mean scores on the PDS were as follows: T1: M \u00bc 10.42, SD \u00bc 9.95; T2: M \u00bc 7.13, SD \u00bc 9.05; T3: M \u00bc 3.39, SD \u00bc 4.82. Initial scores on the PDS are in line with other, largescale studies of parental PTSD, assessed using this measure [\\(Landolt, Vollrath, Ribi, Gnehm, &](#page-7-0) [Sennhauser, 2003](#page-7-0)). Of those parents who completed the PDS at T1 (-4 weeks post-trauma; N \u00bc 88), 11% (n \u00bc 10) reported no symptoms, 47% (n \u00bc 41) reported mild symptoms, 24% (n \u00bc 21) reported moderate symptoms, 15% (n \u00bc 13) reported moderate to severe symptoms, and 3% (n \u00bc 3) reported severe symptoms. Of those parents who completed the PDS at T2 (6 months post-trauma; N \u00bc 56), 23% (n \u00bc 13) reported no symptoms, 54% (n \u00bc 30) reported mild PTSD symptoms, 13% (n \u00bc 7) reported moderate symptoms, 9% (n \u00bc 5) reported moderate to severe symptoms, and 2% (n \u00bc 1) reported severe symptoms. Finally, of the 52 parents who provided PDS scores at T3 (3 years posttrauma), 35% (n \u00bc 18) reported no symptoms, 58% (n \u00bc 30) reported mild PTSD symptoms, 6% (n \u00bc 3) reported moderate symptoms, 2% (n \u00bc 1) reported moderate to severe symptoms, and no parent reported severe PTSD symptoms.\n\n\n\nRegarding measures used in this study, the full questionnaire battery was administered to parents at 2\u20134 weeks post-trauma (T1), while PTSD symptoms were measured again at 6 months (T2) and 3 years post-trauma (T3). Parents typically completed the assessments in their home as part of the larger assessment (see [Meiser-Stedman et al., 2008](#page-8-0)). The only exception to this was the 3-year follow-up, when questionnaires were completed online or returned by post.\n\n#### Measures\n\n# Demographic Variables and Objective Trauma Severity\n\nDemographic and trauma-related information was obtained from parent interviews and from ED notes at T1 (see Table I). Objective trauma severity for the child was assessed using triage category (nurse rating of urgency of care), whether the child was admitted to hospital, and presence of physical injury (whether or not they sustained a fracture).\n\n# Trait Cognitive Vulnerability\n\nTwo measures assessed general trait cognitive vulnerability; The Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI; [Reiss,](#page-8-0) [Peterson, Gursky, & McNally, 1986\\)](#page-8-0) and the Meta-Cognitions Questionnaire-30-Positive Beliefs about Worry Scale (MCQ-30-PB; [Wells & Cartwright-](#page-8-0)[Hatton, 2004](#page-8-0)). The ASI is a 16-item self-report questionnaire that measures negative beliefs about anxiety as recorded on a 0 (very little) to 4 (very much) scale of agreement with statements such as \"It scares me when I feel faint.\"The measure is considered to be reliable and valid [\\(Peterson & Heilbronner, 1987;](#page-8-0) [Vujanovic et al., 2007](#page-8-0)), with adequate internal consistency also demonstrated in the current study (T1 Cronbach's a \u00bc .91). The MCQ-30-PB is a six-item scale where responses are scored on a 4-point (1\u20134) agreement scale, for statements such as \"I need to worry in order to work well\" and \"worrying helps me\n\nTable I.
