0,0,Is the metric or unit of time used in the statistical model reported?,"The context specifies that the study includes various follow-up assessments conducted at specific time intervals after the traumatic injury. These intervals are explicitly mentioned as 3, 12, 24, and 72 months after the injury, highlighting the timeline involved in assessing PTSD responses. This indicates that the metric or unit of time used in the statistical model is reported. Therefore, the answer is YES. "," - ""indexed PTSD reactions in hospital following traumatic injury and again at 3, 12, 24 and 72 months after injury."" ",YES
0,1,Is information presented about the mean and variance of time within a wave?,"The context discusses various aspects of PTSD trajectory classes, including mental health service utilization and statistical analyses. However, it does not provide explicit information about the mean and variance of time within a wave in terms of its relationship to PTSD trajectories or recovery. The focus is primarily on mental health visits and participant characteristics rather than temporal information related to waves. Therefore, the answer to the question is NO. ", - [] ,NO
0,2,Is the missing data mechanism reported?,"To determine if the missing data mechanism is reported, we need to find sections of the text that discuss how missing data was handled or any potential biases introduced by missing data. The context does mention ""multiple imputation in MPlus to impute missing values of covariates,"" which implies that they addressed missing data, but it does not explicitly discuss the mechanism of the missing data itself in relation to demographics or other variables. Therefore, while they took actions regarding missing data, the specific mechanism is not detailed. So, the answer to this question is NO."," - ""We used multiple imputation in MPlus to impute missing values of covariates.""",NO
0,3,Is a description provided of what variables are related to attrition/missing data?,"The context specifies that individuals who refused to participate in the study or did not complete the assessments did not differ significantly from participants in various demographic and clinical aspects, such as gender, presence of a mTBI, education, and mechanisms of injury. However, those who did not complete the 6-year assessment were noted to be younger and had higher baseline CAPS scores, indicating variables related to attrition. Thus, we have information related to variables influencing attrition and missing data. Therefore, the answer to the question is YES."," - ""Individuals who refused to participate in the study did not differ from participants in gender, the presence of a mTBI, education, mechanism of injury, length of stay or ISS."" - ""Those who did not complete the 6-year assessment differed from completers in that they were more likely to be younger (mean 36.33 (s.d. = 13.56) v. 39.53 (s.d. = 13.48), (t(1126) = 3.97, P<0.001) and have higher baseline Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-IV (CAPS) scores (mean 20.21 (s.d. = 17.89) v. 16.13, (s.d. = 15.06), (t(1113.9) = 4.17, P50.001).""",YES
0,4,Is a description provided of how missing data in the analyses were dealt with?,"To determine if the paper describes how missing data were managed, we need to look for any specific mentions of procedures or methods used in handling incomplete data. The context states that ""We used multiple imputation in MPlus to impute missing values of covariates,"" clearly demonstrating that a specific method (multiple imputation) was utilized for addressing missing data. Therefore, the answer to whether there is a description of how missing data were dealt with is YES. "," - ""We used multiple imputation in MPlus to impute missing values of covariates.""",YES
0,5,Is information about the distribution of the observed variables included?,"To determine if the context includes information about the distribution of the observed variables, we can analyze the descriptions and statistics provided in the text. The context provides detailed demographic characteristics (gender, age, type of injury, etc.) along with their respective distributions for both the total sample and for those with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) compared to those without. This indicates the presence of data on how the observed variables are distributed across the sample. Therefore, it supports the conclusion that information about the distribution of the observed variables is indeed included.

0,6,Is the software that was used for the statistical analysis mentioned?,"To answer the question, we need to check if there's any mention of the software used for statistical analysis within the context. The text explicitly states that ""We employed latent class growth analysis (LCGA) to examine PTSD trajectories, using Mplus version 6.2 for Windows,"" which clearly identifies the software used for data analysis as Mplus. Therefore, the answer to the question is YES."," - ""We employed latent class growth analysis (LCGA) to examine PTSD trajectories, using Mplus version 6.2 for Windows.""",YES
0,7,"Are alternative specifications of within-class heterogeneity considered (e.g., LGCA vs. LGMM) and clearly documented?","The context does not mention any alternative specifications of within-class heterogeneity, such as Latent Growth Curve Analysis (LGCA) or Latent Growth Mixture Modeling (LGMM). It focuses solely on the unconditional and conditional models and the outcomes related to classes of PTSD responses. As there is no evidence provided that these alternative specifications were considered or documented, the answer is NO.",[],NO
0,8,Are alternative specifications of the between-class differences in variancecovariance matrix structure considered and clearly documented?,"The context does not provide any indication that alternative specifications of the between-class differences in the variance-covariance matrix structure are considered or documented. It focuses primarily on the trajectories of PTSD response and the predictors of class membership, but does not reference specifications related to the variance-covariance matrix. Therefore, I conclude that this aspect is not addressed in the provided information. ",[],NO
0,9,Are alternative shape/functional forms of the trajectories described?,"The context describes five different trajectories of PTSD response but does not indicate alternative shape or functional forms beyond these trajectories. The trajectories mentioned are chronic, recovery, worsening/recovery, worsening, and resilient. However, there is no mention of any alternative forms or additional shapes of these trajectories that differ from the stated ones. Therefore, the answer should be NO."," - ""This study found five different trajectories of PTSD response over the 6 years after injury."" - ""Patients followed five distinct trajectories: a chronic class (4%), a recovery class (6%), a worsening/recovery class (8%), a worsening class (10%) and a resilient class (73%).""",NO
0,10,"If covariates or predictors have been used, is it done in such a way that the analyses could be replicated?","The context states that ""Only covariates that were significant predictors of class membership and improved model fit were retained in the final solution."" This indicates that the selection of covariates was systematic and based on objective criteria regarding model fit, which supports replicability in the analyses. Additionally, it mentions the use of logistic regression analyses to identify predictors, a common method that can be transparent and replicable when documented properly. Since the methods and reasons for choosing the covariates are provided, it suggests that other researchers could replicate the analyses. Therefore, the answer to this question is YES.

Therefore, there is no evidence provided that addresses the specific question about the reporting of random start values and final iterations. Hence, the answer should be NO.",[],NO
0,12,Are the model comparison (and selection) tools described from a statistical perspective?,"To determine if the model comparison and selection tools are described from a statistical perspective, we can look for references to statistical methods or analyses used in the study. The context discusses the use of latent class growth analysis (LCGA) and mentions model fit, which aligns with statistical evaluation techniques. Furthermore, it describes how different variables were tested and retained based on their significance in improving model fit.
