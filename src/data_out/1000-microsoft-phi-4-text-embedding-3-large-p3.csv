The focus is on identifying multiple trajectory groups and using covariates to differentiate them, but there is no evidence of testing different trajectory shapes.

37,10,"To determine if the analyses could be replicated, we need to check if the study provides sufficient details about the covariates or predictors used, including whether they are time-varying or time-invariant and their role in the analysis. The context mentions that a logistic regression was performed with three covariates: age, scores on ASDS, and scores on CSS. It provides odds ratios, confidence intervals, and p-values for these covariates, indicating that they are time-invariant as they are baseline measures. However, the context does not specify if these covariates were used at the level of dependent or independent variables in the logistic regression, nor does it mention the use of time-varying covariates. Therefore, while some details are provided, the lack of information on the specific use of covariates in the analysis suggests that replication might be challenging without additional information.

The context discusses various fit indices and methods used to determine the model with the most parsimonious number of classes, but it does not mention anything about the number of random start values or final iterations. There is no reference to the convergence of the final class solution or the use of maximum likelihood (ML) estimation specifics such as random start values or iterations. ", - [] ,NO
37,12,"To determine if the model comparison tools are described from a statistical perspective, we need to identify if the context provides statistical definitions or explanations for the tools mentioned, such as AIC, BIC, and ssaBIC. The context references these tools and provides their full forms, along with citations to original works that likely contain statistical definitions (e.g., Akaike, 1987; Schwartz, 1978; Sclove, 1987). Additionally, the context explains that lower values of these criteria indicate a superior fit, which is a statistical concept. Therefore, the tools are described from a statistical perspective.
