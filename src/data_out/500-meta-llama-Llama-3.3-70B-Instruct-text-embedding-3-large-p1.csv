The context mentions that the model includes life events at 3 months, 12 months, and 24 months following trauma exposure.

The context mentions that individuals who did not complete the 72-month assessment did not differ from those who were recruited in terms of several variables, but those who did not complete the 6-year assessment differed in that they were more likely to be younger. This suggests that age is related to attrition, but other variables such as gender, the presence of a mTBI, education, mechanism of injury, length of stay or ISS are not. Furthermore, the use of multiple imputation in MPlus to impute missing values of covariates implies that the model accounts for missing data but does not specify which variables are related to it.

Furthermore, the context notes that ""multiple imputation in MPlus to impute missing values of covariates"" was used, which implies that efforts were made to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the data. Given this attention to detail and the careful selection of covariates, it is reasonable to conclude that the use of covariates does not inherently prevent analyses from being replicated.
